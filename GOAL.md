# Core UI Goal (HS-Biz-Agent)

Core UI exists to make HubSpot CRM easier to operate for non-technical teams while preserving the power of automation, tagging, reporting, and data hygiene.

## Problem
HubSpot is powerful but confusing. Key features (automation, segmentation, reporting, and lifecycle logic) are hard to configure correctly, so most portals end up messy, inconsistent, and underperforming.

## Goal
Provide a simple, visual operating layer that:
- makes critical CRM logic easy to see and understand
- lets users make safe, guided changes with clear impact
- writes those changes back to HubSpot so the portal stays the source of truth

## What “Success” Looks Like
- Users can fix data quality, segmentation, and automation issues in minutes (not hours).
- Any change made in Core UI is reflected in HubSpot (tags, properties, workflows, and reports).
- The UI focuses on a small number of high‑value actions that work reliably.

## Core Principles
- **Clarity over complexity**: show only what helps people take action.
- **HubSpot stays canonical**: Core UI is an operator console, not a parallel CRM.
- **Explain the why**: every insight and action should be understandable.
- **Safe by default**: changes are reversible or clearly scoped.

## Scope (v1)
- Visualize and manage lead status + tagging
- Simplify segmentation and reporting
- Surface automation gaps and recommend fixes
- Apply changes back to HubSpot
